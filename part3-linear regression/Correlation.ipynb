    "# Understanding Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two variables are related to each other. It is essential for understanding how one variable behaves in relation to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Statistical Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean (average) of a dataset is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values. For a set of values $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$, the mean $\\bar{x}$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Deviation\n",
    "Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of a set of data points around the mean. It is calculated as the square root of the variance. The standard deviation $\\sigma$ is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Covariance\n",
    "Covariance measures the joint variability of two random variables. If $X$ and $Y$ are two variables, their covariance is calculated as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{X})(y_i - \\bar{Y})}{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correlation Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pearson Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient normalizes the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the variables, thus providing a dimensionless measure of linear relationship. It is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}\n",
    "$$\n",

It provides an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation if the data points are a sample from a larger population. The use of `n-1` as the denominator corrects for the bias in estimating a population parameter from a sample.\n",
